                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a junior undergraduate student at School of Computer Science of Carnegie Mellon University. I have a strong interest in multiple fields of computer science: software engineering, computer graphics and machine learning.</p>
                <p>I really enjoy exploring new fields and technologies by working on projects from scratch. Thus, in Hackprinceton, my teammates and I challenged ourselves to create an application that displays VR scenes created from stylizes panorama images. In this process, we self-taught the construction of Unity VR scene, adjustment of Android gyroscope and deployment of scenes from Unity to Android. These new learnt techniques were also well combined by shell with our knowledge of Convoluted neural network to create the eventual app we expected.</p>
                <p>This spirit of exploration has been carried on by me to my internship at Woobo. I added the pronunciation grading feature web service to the backend of Woobo, the intelligent education robot for children. During my internship, I improved performance of grading by researching paper, wrote a web server for the the grading service by learning a new API Tornado and containerized the web service by exploring Docker.</p>
                <p>In Addition to learning new skills, I would love to delve deeper into what I have learned. When taking the Computational Photography, I was intrigued by the Eulerian Video Magnification assignment, in which I implemented a pipeline that amplifies unnoticeable movements in videos via Laplacian pyramid and band pass filter. To increase my expertise in Computational photography and computer graphics, I am currently under advice of Professor Ioannis Gkioulekas to develop rendering tools for computational photography. Specifically, I am expanding an existing physicals-accurate render Mitsuba to simulate various modern types of images, including: structured light, epipolar imaging, transient imaging, speckle imaging and light transport probing.</p>
